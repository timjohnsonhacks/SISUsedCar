    * I like what you're going for here. Keeping the network services and image services their own individual entity.
    * I think a better practice is actually only having one instance of a network service. This keeps all of the networking
    * being handled by one object, which is better for following the flow of data through one object, as opposed to multiple.
    * This allows for easier debugging, easier thread management, etc. I don't suggest using a singleton, but I do think its
    * worth using a single instance throughout the application that is passed around where you need it. I recommend the same
    * for the image service.

    * is what is being displayed, not really any other changes. A better solution is to just have one array hold on to
